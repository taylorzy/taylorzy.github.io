<li>Tools</li>

Tools are important to improve the productivity. I experienced some of the famous IDEs will studying and working.
I used Emacs when I start to learn programming, it is easy to learn (compared with vi), clean user interface, very good for beginners I think. I know that some of the most skillful developers are still using it. But now most of the industry is using intelligent IDEs to help increasing coding efficiency, emacs or vi is not suitable for commercial use currently.

Then I started to use Eclipse for Windows/Linux or MyEclipse for Mac, I soon found it is far more convinient than Emacs or vi. I stick with Eclipse for at least 5 years until I tried Intellij IDA. Intellij IDA is the most intelligent and productive java web development IDE in my opinion. Many people has asked me the same question, Intellij vs Eclipse, why do you think Intellij is better? Here I'll list all the reasons I found.

<ul>
	<li>Intellij has better reaction speed, the suggestions or warnings or errors will come up while developers typing</li>
	<li>Intellij never hang up, but Eclipse crush is the main problem I met during some big projects</li>
	<li>Intellij's quick fix is more intelligent than Eclipse, it turns to give me better suggestions</li>
	<li>Intellij not only support java well, it also supports JavaScript, HTML or even CSS(i.e. can see actual color from CSS color code)</li>
	<li>Intellij has better refactor, it searches for text as well, but Eclipse only do refactor on the current variable name</li>
	<li>In intellij, developer can search for and go to referenced file even for .properties file</li>
	<li>Intellij's debug mode won't change IDE view, and it show all the variables' value for each executed lines</li>
	<li>Intellij has built-in test coverage tool(Paid version)</li>
</ul>

I've also used Visual Studio 2013 for C# development, it's also built for web app developing, has good cross language support. But it take up too much memory, runs slowly in my office computer.

Below is a reading radar from thought works, I am following the first circle:

Some other books I think useful I'll add them here:
Introduction to Algorithms
Thinking in Java
Programming Pearls
Artificial Intelligence A Mordern Approach

<li>Continuous integration</li>
CI must run for 
Below has a list of all CI servers for Java
"http://www.infoq.com/research/ci-server":http://www.infoq.com/research/ci-server

<li>Knowledge System</li>
For my own opinion, a good developer must know some of the knowledges below:
<ul>
	<li>Fair good Math</li>
	<li>Strong logic</li>
	<li>Strong data structure and common algorithms</li>
	<li>Unix/Linux shell script and Windows command line</li>
	<li>Computer network and mobile wirelesss network knowledge</li>
	<li>DB knowledge</li>
	<li>Fundamentals of compiling</li>
	<li>Design of system, design patterns</li>
	<li>At least one Object Oriented programming language, one script language and C</li>
	<li>Documentation</li>
</ul>

<li>Blog</li>
Write done thoughts and experiences to somewhere and make sure will read the past blogs every now and then.

<li>Keep practicing</li>
The only way to improve is keep working, learn from experience.
