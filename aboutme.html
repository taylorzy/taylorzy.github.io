	<h2 class="categoryTitle bottomLine">About me</h2>

	<p>I am a full stack Java web application developer. I have experiences in both developing applications from scratch and maintaining legacy systems. I've done some web and mobile applications for government and other companies. Keen to learn new skills, like to discuss with other computer nerds. </p>

	<p>Also an enthusiastic gamer, which is the reason driven me to chase a developer career. Only care of a game's connotation, believing CG and pictures are not important for a good game. </p>

	<p>An awful but long time amateur basketball player, start playing since 1999. My favorite stars are Michael Jordan and Tracy McGrady. </p>

	<p>A soccor fan following Manchester United since David Beckham started his MANU career.</p>
